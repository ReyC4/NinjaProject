## 🔴About
My project is a 2D game that I'm developing using Unity and C#. In this game, the player controls the main character from a top-down perspective, battling various enemies. A key feature of the game is the attack system, which is triggered by pressing a button. When the attack button is pressed, the main character performs an attack animation programmed using trigger animations in Unity's Animator. This feature provides a more dynamic and interactive gameplay experience, allowing players to feel a more responsive and realistic control over the character's actions in the game.
